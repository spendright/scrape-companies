SpendRight companies scraper
============================

The goal of this project is to generate information about companies mentioned
in buyer's guides (e.g. http://www.hrc.org/apps/buyersguide/index.php),
including complete, correct lists of brands. These can be used to power
brand screens, browser extensions, barcode-scanning apps, etc.

This is a project of [SpendRight](http://spendright.org). You can contact
the author (David Marin) at dave@spendright.org.
